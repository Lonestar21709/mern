start with making backend dir
1)npm init ->builds json file
then
2)npm install express cors mongoose dotenv -> install packages
express -> framework for nodejs
cors -> cross origin resource sharing -> ajax reqs to skip same origin policy and access resource from remote hosts, allows us to easily access things outside our server
mongoose -> helps with interacting with mongoDB through nodejs
dotenv -> loads environment variables from a dotenv file into a process dotenv file , instead of setting environment variables in dev machine they can be stored into a file, makes dev simpler 
3) instlal -g nodemon
nodemon - tool that helps install nodejs apps, by auto restarting the node app when file changes in dir are detected
4)create server.js in backend/
-include all the  middle ware/dependices -> mongoose, cors, express, dotenv
-create env file to create environment variables to connect to mongodb

5)create schema using mongoose - exercise and user

6)create routes to schemas in routes directory, and then set up in server.js
7)create user and exercise routes, CRUD for exercises
8)tested using insomnia

done with backend!
